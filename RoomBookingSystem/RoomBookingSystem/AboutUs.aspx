                <p>Established in 2015, a few of the students in the SD 20 Software and Development group decided to take it upon themeselves to try to create a classroom booking system.  
                    The team felt that it would have been a great benefit if the staff and instructors at Robertson College could be able to access and book classrooms with ease in order to lessen the hassles to maximize the learning experience for all students. </p><br />
